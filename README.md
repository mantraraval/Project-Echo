# üéì Project Echo: Agentic AI Pipeline for Verified, Multi-Modal Research Synthesis  

**Project Echo** is a high-assurance **AI Agent Workflow** that automates the retrieval, validation, and multi-modal delivery of research content.  
It combines **Perplexity AI API** for evidence-based article reading and summarization, **OpenAI GPT API** for guardrails and quality evaluation, and a **OpenAI TTS engine** for audio generation.  
The workflow ends with automated email delivery of summarised audio file, creating a complete end-to-end research automation pipeline.

## üéØ I. Workflow Overview  

Project Echo follows a structured, four-step pipeline:

1. **Article Retrieval & Summarization** ‚Üí Fetches articles and generates initial summaries.  
2. **Guardrails & Verification** ‚Üí Evaluates summaries to ensure factual accuracy and appropriateness.  
3. **Audio Generation** ‚Üí Converts verified summaries into natural-sounding audio.  
4. **Automated Delivery** ‚Üí Sends the final text + audio to the user via email.
